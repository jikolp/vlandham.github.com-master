  <p>An experiment that allows users to explore their most-listened to songs, and the tags associated with these songs.</p>
  <p>User names are faked - but the rest of the data is real. User-song play counts come from the <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a>. Tag data comes from <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm">Last.fm</a></p>
  <p>Visualization includes a force-directed layout with tag nodes suspended in a circular orientation.</p>
  <p>Song nodes are drawn towards the tags they are associated with. Also enjoy the dot plot and interactive slopegraph!</p>

  <p>Just in case you need a simplified, animated version of the iconic <i>The Basic Elements of Creativity</i> visual, here you go!</p>
  <p>The quote and original inspiration come from the wonderful <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/everything-is-a-remix-part-3/">video series by Kirby Ferguson</a> of the same name.</p>
  <p>Remix this and enjoy!</p><br/><br/>

  <p>I was asked to contribute to an online interactive piece for the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/">Dallas Morning News</a> that allowed readers to compare Dallas neighborhoods on a number of different metrics. </p>

  <p>This piece provides both scatter plot and interactive map, allowing the user to zoom in on one of over 500 neighborhoods in the metro area. An accompanying piece allows users to discover neighborhoods that best match their tastes over a number of factors.</p>

  <p>Another <a href="http://flowingdata.com">Flowing Data</a> tutorial! This tutorial is again combined with a demo of animating between chart types in a visualization</p>

  <p>The data for this demo was aggregated from New York City <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">311 call requests</a>. Here, we look at the requests around the time of the Sandy Hurricane of 2012 from different perspectives.</p>

  <p>Small Multiples are a powerful way to display changes over time. In this experiment, I look at an expansion to the basic small multiples idea by adding interactive overlays for showing details of a particular small multiple.</p>

  <p>In this example, we look at CO2 emissions over time. However, the methodology demonstrated could be used in any small multiples visualization where additional information on individual graphs would be valuable. </p>

  <p>Custom sliders allow users to filter over 5,500 GSA properties in the USA. Locations are displayed on an interactive map and metrics for the filtered properties are automatically updated.</p>

  <p>A fun little web-app that allows you to make custom Delaunay-style maps in the tradition of the <a href="http://feltron.com/">Feltron Report</a>.</p>
  <p>Add new points, change the background and annotation colors, modify the annotations, and then save the resulting visualization for later. Uses D3.js and a number of jQuery plugins to make magical things happen.</p><br/>

<p>An interesting use of force-directed graphs combined with geographical maps: the force-directed map. Used here to create a visual representation of how segregation in U.S. cities effects communities today.</p>
<p>Areas with sharply segregated boundaries push away from each other, while areas of homogeneity stay largely static</p>
  <p>The <a class="" href="http://vallandingham.me/visualizing_the_racial_divide.html">Original Blog Post</a> describes the visualization in more detail. Uses d3.js and looks best in Google Chrome.</p>

  <p>As part of the initial analysis for <a href="">Track Tag Love</a>, I created this simple chart which attempts to compare between songs that are heard relatively few times - given the number of people who have listened to them, and songs that are listened to many times by many users.</p>
  <p>I didn't come to any startling conclusions - and so the analysis was not furthered. However, the light use of interaction to increase annotation and emphasize might be worth exploring further in the future.</p>

<p>A selection of charts from the turn of the century recreated using <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3.js</a>. I wanted to get a chance to practice basic visualization techniques using d3, as well as learn a bit of <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffeescript</a> in the process. I am also fascinated with America's past. Thus, recreating old visualizations using modern technologies seemed like a good fit.</p>

<p><a href="http://vallandingham.me/recreating_old_vis_with_new_tech.html">Here is my original blog post on this visualization</a>.</p>

<p>With these recreations, I attempt to stay true to the original design. Because the process of extracting the raw data out of the original graphs is rather labor intensive, not all the data points are displayed in these updated versions. Also, because of the manual process, values might not exactly match the originals. Visualizations look good in Chrome and Firefox 4.</p>

<p>Managing licenses for shared applications, and knowing when to add more licenses can be tricky. This dashboard satisfies a need of knowing how often the licenses for a particular piece of shared software, Matlab, were being maxed out. Matlab has an interesting license structure in which each package has their own number of licenses - independent of the overall Matlab licenses. So there was a need to track each package's license separately.</p>

<p>This simple dashboard provides an overview of when licenses are being used, when these licenses are being maxed out, and who is using these licenses.</p>
