As I have been busy "creating":http://flowingdata.com/2012/08/02/how-to-make-an-interactive-network-visualization/ "tutorials":http://flowingdata.com/2013/01/17/how-to-animate-transitions-between-multiple-charts/ for FlowingData, I haven't updated this site in a while. 

I wanted to point out a new fledgling project I've started: "VisKC.com":http://viskc.com/ - an aggregation site for Kansas City centric data visualizations. 

<div class="center">
<a href="http://viskc.com/"><img class="center" src="http://vallandingham.me/images/vis/viskc.png" alt="visKC logo" style="border:1px dotted #cccccc;"/></a>
</div>

With this site I'd like to highlight interesting maps, visualizations, as well as data that focus on the Kansas City Metro area. Right now its mostly maps (as expected) and some data. I hope to update about once a week.

In the future, I'd like to use it as a way to showcase some of my own KC based visualizations. 

So, if you get a hankering for some local Data Vis, come on down to "VisKC.com":http://viskc.com/ !
